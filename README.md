# ~~CorpThingDoSomethingPls

~~CorpThing, pls.

~~- Checks for updates on nightcorp.net every 15 seconds
- Checks if CorpThing has shitposted any new comments or posts on reddit every 15 seconds too.
~~- Plays a sweet brass bell sound if he did.

~~Compile and run. Built binary already in bin/Debug/CorpthingPls.exe


~~P.S.
I did not actually test the logging to file part so it might crash. But it will ding first and that's good news anyway.

~~P.P.S.
Yes I struggled with markdown.~~
